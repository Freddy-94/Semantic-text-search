# Semantic text search exercise

## Description

This set of programs correspond to functions that extract data from three different PDF files and see a proof-of-concept demonstration of semantic text search, by using Nearest neighbor search (NNS)
 
Relevant functions:
1.  extract_text_from_pdf -> To extract text from PDF files
2.  extract_text_from_docx -> To extract text from docx files
3.  generate_embeddings  -> To generate embeddings for the given text using Sentence Transformers
4.  near_neigh   -> Function that implements nearest_neighbor search

The main program is 'nearest_neighbor.py', and it's run simply by writing nearest_neighbor.py in the console.
